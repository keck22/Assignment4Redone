# Executive Summary
This week we will learn how to create subqueries from joins, and continue to write select statements using new functions such as format, convert, and cast.
# Query Review
The first query I made we replaced a join with a subquery that uses the keyword IN. For this I called the category_name from categories then used the in keyword to link both the category name with the products and then ordered it by category_name. 
The second query was the most difficult. I attempted to grab the average price from the item_price and then use product name to specify what the product was above the average price of the item_price. 
The third query seemed to be pretty straight forward. I called the list_price column from there I Format, Convert, and Cast to return these integers as signed integers and was able to select how many decimal places I wanted.
The last query I started off by calling the email addresses from the customers table. Second I was able to count the characters and name it as "Length". Third we tried to locate the "@" symbol. Next we created an email adress username from the information that occurs before the "@" symbol. Lastly, we called the "@" and the rest of the customer email and named them domain
# Conclusion
This week we have been taught how to make subqueries and when to use them as well as an introduction on new functions.
